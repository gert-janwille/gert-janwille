Cool stuff can be found here.\n * - types/   All the magic that is need to have observable objects, arrays and values is in this folder. Including the modifiers like `asFlat`.\n * - utils/   Utility stuff.\n *\n */\nvar extras = {\n    allowStateChanges: allowStateChanges,\n    deepEqual: deepEqual,\n    getAtom: getAtom,\n    getDebugName: getDebugName,\n    getDependencyTree: getDependencyTree,\n    getAdministration: getAdministration,\n    getGlobalState: getGlobalState,\n    getObserverTree: getObserverTree,\n    interceptReads: interceptReads,\n    isComputingDerivation: isComputingDerivation,\n    isSpyEnabled: isSpyEnabled,\n    onReactionError: onReactionError,\n    reserveArrayBuffer: reserveArrayBuffer,\n    resetGlobalState: resetGlobalState,\n    isolateGlobalState: isolateGlobalState,\n    shareGlobalState: shareGlobalState,\n    spyReport: spyReport,\n    spyReportEnd: spyReportEnd,\n    spyReportStart: spyReportStart,\n    setReactionScheduler: setReactionScheduler\n};\nvar everything = {\n    Reaction: Reaction,\n    untracked: untracked,\n    Atom: Atom,\n    BaseAtom: BaseAtom,\n    useStrict: useStrict,\n    isStrictModeEnabled: isStrictModeEnabled,\n    spy: spy,\n    comparer: comparer,\n    asReference: asReference,\n    asFlat: asFlat,\n    asStructure: asStructure,\n    asMap: asMap,\n    isModifierDescriptor: isModifierDescriptor,\n    isObservableObject: isObservableObject,\n    isBoxedObservable: isObservableValue,\n    isObservableArray: isObservableArray,\n    ObservableMap: ObservableMap,\n    isObservableMap: isObservableMap,\n    map: map,\n    transaction: transaction,\n    observable: observable,\n    computed: computed,\n    isObservable: isObservable,\n    isComputed: isComputed,\n    extendObservable: extendObservable,\n    extendShallowObservable: extendShallowObservable,\n    observe: observe,\n    intercept: intercept,\n    autorun: autorun,\n    autorunAsync: autorunAsync,\n    when: when,\n    reaction: reaction,\n    action: action,\n    isAction: isAction,\n    runInAction: runInAction,\n    expr: expr,\n    toJS: toJS,\n    createTransformer: createTransformer,\n    whyRun: whyRun,\n    isArrayLike: isArrayLike,\n    extras: extras\n};\nvar warnedAboutDefaultExport = false;\nvar _loop_1 = function (p) {\n    var val = everything[p];\n    Object.defineProperty(everything, p, {\n        get: function () {\n            if (!warnedAboutDefaultExport) {\n                warnedAboutDefaultExport = true;\n                console.warn(\"Using default export (`import mobx from 'mobx'`) is deprecated \" +\n                    \"and won’t work in mobx@4.0.0\\n\" +\n                    \"Use `import * as mobx from 'mobx'` instead\");\n            }\n            return val;\n        }\n    });\n};\nfor (var p in everything) {\n    _loop_1(p);\n}\nif (typeof __MOBX_DEVTOOLS_GLOBAL_HOOK__ === \"object\") {\n    __MOBX_DEVTOOLS_GLOBAL_HOOK__.injectMobx({ spy: spy, extras: extras });\n}\n\nexport { extras, Reaction, untracked, IDerivationState, Atom, BaseAtom, useStrict, isStrictModeEnabled, spy, comparer, asReference, asFlat, asStructure, asMap, isModifierDescriptor, isObservableObject, isObservableValue as isBoxedObservable, isObservableArray, ObservableMap, isObservableMap, map, transaction, observable, computed, isObservable, isComputed, extendObservable, extendShallowObservable, observe, intercept, autorun, autorunAsync, when, reaction, action, isAction, runInAction, expr, toJS, createTransformer, whyRun, trace, isArrayLike };export default everything;\n\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./~/mobx/lib/mobx.module.js\n// module id = 66\n// module chunks = 0","var isarray = require('isarray')\n\n/**\n * Expose `pathToRegexp`.\n */\nmodule.exports = pathToRegexp\nmodule.exports.parse = parse\nmodule.exports.compile = compile\nmodule.exports.tokensToFunction = tokensToFunction\nmodule.exports.tokensToRegExp = tokensToRegExp\n\n/**\n * The main path matching regexp utility.\n *\n * @type {RegExp}\n */\nvar PATH_REGEXP = new RegExp([\n  // Match escaped characters that would otherwise appear in future matches.\n  // This allows the user to escape special characters that won't transform.\n  '(\\\\\\\\.)',\n  // Match Express-style parameters and un-named parameters with a prefix\n  // and optional suffixes.
